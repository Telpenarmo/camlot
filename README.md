# RideML

RideML is an experimental programming language focusing on IDE support.
I work on it to research IDE-friendly traits of PL design, learn tools and techniques used in top language servers, and for fun.
RideML is very much work-in-progress: for now there's only parser, a minimal language server and a trivial vscode extension.
Takes strong inspiration from [rust-analyzer](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer/).
